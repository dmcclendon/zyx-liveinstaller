ZyX-LiveInstaller Development Roadmap/TODO
=============================================================================

NOTE: Active development has currently stalled.  New developers are 
      encouraged to submit patches for anything below, or any itch 
      of their own they would like to scratch.  For the timebeing, 
      only showstopping functional bugs will be likely to be addressed.

Short term
----------

- verify nothing left to undo that happened in initramfs 
- undo anything that happened in init.d/*live* 
  - time seddage, etc...
  - enable services disabled (crond/atd/mdmonitor/etc...)
    - perhaps ui for user to choose checkboxes
- wholedisk choices need to preclude subsequent selection of child partitions
- keep mounted (/proc/mounts) devices out of lists (i.e. your live device)
 - and parent whole disks
- check for running copy of self and exit or simple error if found

Midterm
-------

- rebootful option
- live rebootless and/or rebootful options
- bugzilla, git, mailman, ...
- untemphack python26 issue 
  - it's there because I'm building on an f10-derived system, but for f11+ use
- installation abort needs to try and recover sane LiveOS environment
- catch/handle all exceptions
- mount readonly pristine root to use as sources for 
       late-install undoing of livestuff
- need warning facility similar to error facility
  - perhaps 2 varians, warning_with_back, and warning_with_confirm,
    i.e. for cases where the user must undo, or just show extra cogniscence.
  - first case: no gparted or palimpsest installed, =warning_with_back 
- when scanning, try blockdev --getro, if true or no medium, leave off list

Longterm
--------

- zyx-only: try removing -l's from umounts, see if they are still needed.
- handle f11 situation a bit more nicely, i.e. 
 - perhaps a checkbox - 'remove liveuser account after logout'
 - perhaps a create user page
       
- pyparted (wait for viros f11 rebase, pyparted 2.x presumably, perhaps 
            by then some better pyparted documentation or test/examples)
   - ask about lgpl, test cases, review of zli for relatedness

- optimize lvm rootfs case, removing linear layer (seems like it should be doable)
- buttons should have fixed width (tied to widest, maybe just use space
   padding)
