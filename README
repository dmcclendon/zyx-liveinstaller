ZyX-LiveInstaller: A 'rebootless' LiveOS installer
==================================================

The short story is- neat devicemapper tricks to live migrate the running
LiveOS root filesystem from cdrom/usb+ram to the local system disk.  Thus
after installation, you can continue using your now installed system without
the traditional step of rebooting.

For more information, make sure to read all the documentation contained
under the ./info subdirectory.

This program is still in early development.  To build, after having unpacked
the tree on your local fedora-12 or similar system, type 'make rpm' in the
toplevel directory.  The resulting rpm may be installed on a running LiveOS,
or preferably built directly into the LiveOS during mastering.  Then, to
invoke the installer, type './zyx-liveinstaller' at the commandline, or look
under the SystemTools desktop menu category, for 'ZyX-LiveInstaller'.

Then read information and warnings carefully as the installation wizard
guides you.
